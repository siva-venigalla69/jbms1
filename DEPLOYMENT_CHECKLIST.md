ALTER TABLE material_out ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id);

-- Update existing material_in records to link customer_id from orders
UPDATE material_in 
SET customer_id = orders.customer_id 
FROM orders 
WHERE material_in.order_id = orders.id 
AND material_in.customer_id IS NULL;

-- Update existing material_out records to link customer_id from challans
UPDATE material_out 
SET customer_id = delivery_challans.customer_id 
FROM delivery_challans 
WHERE material_out.challan_id = delivery_challans.id 
AND material_out.customer_id IS NULL;
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend Changes
```bash
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement complete functional requirements - orders, materials, expenses, inventory fixes"

# Push to trigger Render deployment
git push origin main
```

### 2. Run Database Migrations
- After deployment, run the SQL migrations above on the production database
- Verify all tables have required columns

### 3. Test Functionality
```bash
# Run comprehensive API tests
python test_api_functionality.py
```

## Known Issues to Fix Post-Deployment

1. **Order Creation 500 Error**: Likely due to missing order_number in deployed version
2. **Inventory Creation 500 Error**: Supplier field mapping needs deployment  
3. **Expenses 404 Error**: New API endpoint needs deployment
4. **Material Tracking**: Depends on order creation fix

## Success Metrics

After deployment, these should all work:
- ✅ Authentication 
- ✅ Customer management (create, list, duplicate prevention)
- ⏳ Order creation with auto-generated numbers
- ⏳ Material tracking with customer linking
- ⏳ Inventory management
