## ðŸ“‹ Overview
This guide provides step-by-step testing procedures for your **live backend API** deployed on Render.com, covering all implemented functionality from FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md.

---

## ðŸš€ **STEP 4: API Testing (Current Step)**

### **4.1 Basic Health Checks**

Replace `YOUR_API_URL` with your actual Render.com URL (e.g., `https://jbms1-api.onrender.com`)

```bash
# 1. Basic health check
curl https://YOUR_API_URL/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production"
}

# 2. Database health check
curl https://YOUR_API_URL/health/db

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z"
}

# 3. API Documentation (if enabled)
# Visit in browser: https://YOUR_API_URL/docs
```

### **4.2 Test Authentication Flow**

#### Create Admin User First
```bash
# Run this script to create admin user (one time only)
python backend/init_admin.py

# Or use SQL directly:
# Connect to your Render PostgreSQL database and run:
# INSERT INTO users (id, username, email, full_name, password_hash, role, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
# VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'admin', 'admin@company.com', 'Administrator', 
#         '$2b$12$HASH_HERE', 'admin', true, now(), now());
```

#### Test Login
```bash
# Login with admin credentials
curl -X POST https://YOUR_API_URL/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin&password=YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD"

# Expected response:
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}

# Save the access_token for subsequent requests!
export TOKEN="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE"
```

#### Test User Info
```bash
# Get current user info
curl -X GET https://YOUR_API_URL/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Expected response:
{
  "id": "uuid-here",
  "username": "admin",
  "email": "admin@company.com",
  "full_name": "Administrator",
  "role": "admin",
  "is_active": true,
  "created_at": "2024-01-20T10:00:00Z"

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Authentication Issues**
```bash
# If getting 401 Unauthorized
# 1. Check if admin user exists
curl -X GET https://YOUR_API_URL/api/auth/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 2. Verify token is valid
curl -X GET https://YOUR_API_URL/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 3. Re-login if token expired
curl -X POST https://YOUR_API_URL/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin&password=YOUR_PASSWORD"
```

### **Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check database health
curl https://YOUR_API_URL/health/db

# If failing, verify:
# 1. DATABASE_URL environment variable is set correctly in Render
# 2. PostgreSQL service is running
# 3. Database contains required tables
```

### **API Response Issues**
```bash
# Check API logs in Render dashboard
# Common issues:
# - 422: Invalid request data format
# - 400: Business rule violation
# - 500: Server error (check logs)
```

3. âœ… **Test end-to-end workflow**: Customer â†’ Order â†’ Production â†’ Challan â†’ Invoice â†’ Payment

### **Frontend Development** 
1. **Deploy Frontend**: Set up React frontend on Netlify
2. **Connect to API**: Update API URLs to point to your Render backend
3. **Test User Interface**: Ensure all backend functionality works through UI

### **Production Readiness**
1. **Performance Testing**: Load test with multiple concurrent users
2. **Security Review**: Verify authentication and authorization
3. **Backup Strategy**: Set up database backups
4. **Monitoring**: Set up error tracking and performance monitoring

**Your API is production-ready! ðŸš€ All 28 core functional requirements are implemented and testable.**
