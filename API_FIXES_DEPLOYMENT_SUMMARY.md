3. `backend/app/api/reports.py` - **ADDED 3 NEW ENDPOINTS**
4. `backend/app/main.py` - **ADDED ROUTER INCLUDES**

### Deployment Steps:
```bash
# 1. Commit changes to git
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement returns API, inventory adjustments, and advanced reporting endpoints

- Implement complete returns management API (REQ-029-031)
- Add inventory adjustment endpoint (REQ-035) 
- Add production status, stock holdings, and pending receivables reports (REQ-037-045)
- Fix router configuration to include all APIs
- Improve error handling and validation"

# 2. Push to main branch (triggers Render deployment)
git push origin main

# 3. Verify deployment on Render
# Check deployment logs for any errors
# Test endpoints after deployment
```

### Testing After Deployment:
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite after deployment
python test_fixed_apis_comprehensive.py

# Expected improvements:
